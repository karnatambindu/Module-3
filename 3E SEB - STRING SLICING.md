# AIM
To write a Python function that splits an email ID string into two parts using the "@" symbol.

# ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Define a function named splitstring that accepts one argument a.
3. Inside the function, use the built-in split('@') method to split the string at the "@" symbol. Store the result in a variable x. Print the resulting list x. Call the function with a test email ID.
4. End the program.

# PROGRAM
# 212223060113-Karnatam Bindu
```
def splitstring(a): x=a.split('@') print(x)
```
